Papers we should not include due to being poorly written or AI generated



## Notes

- Sometimes a paper title may appear differently on the arXiv API. For example, "Visual Attention-Prompted Prediction and Learning" (arXiv:2310.08420), according to arXiv API is titled "A visual encoding model based on deep neural networks and transfer learning"

- When testing APIs, there may be latency and aborted connections

- Publication dates of papers from IEEE are missing the day about half the time. They also may come in any of the following formats
    - "April 1988"
    - "2-4 April 2002"
    - "29 Nov.-2 Dec. 2022"
